Hi! I'm Justin! I'm technical and creative, hard-working, eager and quick to learn, friendly and easy to get on with.

### What have you done previously for work?
  * Most recently I was hired by [Social Playground](https:/socialplayground.com.au "Social Playground's Website!") to rebuild their website. Previous to this I undertook freelance Film, Photography and Video-animation roles, and for the 13 odd years before that I had been working as a Radiographer, in many roles and capacities here in Australia and overseas.

### What have you studied previously?
  * After starting my career in Nuclear Medicine I ended up completeing a Bachelor's degree in Medical Radiation Science (Diagnostic Radiography), at the University of Newcastle, and later went on to complete my Masters Degree in Computed Tomography from the University of Sydney.
  * Looking to transition out of the medical field I acquired a Diploma of Creative Arts(Film & TV production) from JMC Academy in Sydney.
  * Finally a Diploma of Software Development from Coder Factory Academy, Sydney.

### What are your career experiences?
  * My background is medical. I have been a Radiographer for the past 13 years. I have worked in many large hospitals all over the world and actively sought training and mentor roles as I love teaching and passing on knowledge. I recognised early on that Radiography didn't allow me the creative freedom I wanted nor the technical difficulty. I studied a the Creative Arts(Film & TV production), which was a refreshing change, but like Radiography it soon became repetitive. My fianc√© has her own company and has a suite of socially engaging digital products and it was here, chatting to the developers she used occasionally that I fell in love with coding. I love how technical and ever evolving it is. There is ALWAYS something to learn, and it is unique in that the more you learn and dive into the technically difficult concepts, the more creative it allows you to be. The perfect fit! I've been obsessed with coding since I started learning and love the many challenges that come with it.

### Why have you decided to become a developer?
  * As above, in my previous roles I felt there was a definite ceiling that I had reached in terms of creativity and technical knowhow. Being a developer is an exciting space to work in as there will always be something new to learn or create.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
