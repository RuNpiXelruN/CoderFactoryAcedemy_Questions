Hi! I'm Justin! I'm technical and creative, hard-working, eager and quick to learn, friendly and easy to get on with.

### 3. What have you done previously for work?
  * Most recently I was hired by [Social Playground](https:/socialplayground.com.au "Social Playground's Website!") to rebuild their website. Previous to this I undertook freelance Film, Photography and Video-animation roles, and for the 13 odd years before that I had been working as a Radiographer, in many roles and capacities here in Australia and overseas.

### 4. What have you studied previously?
  * After starting my career in Nuclear Medicine I ended up completeing a Bachelor's degree in Medical Radiation Science (Diagnostic Radiography), at the University of Newcastle, and later went on to complete my Masters Degree in Computed Tomography from the University of Sydney.
  * Looking to transition out of the medical field I acquired a Diploma of Creative Arts(Film & TV production) from JMC Academy in Sydney.
  * Finally a Diploma of Software Development from Coder Factory Academy, Sydney.

### 5. What are your career experiences?
  * My background is medical. I have been a Radiographer for the past 13 years. I have worked in many large hospitals all over the world and actively sought training and mentor roles as I love teaching and passing on knowledge. I recognised early on that Radiography didn't allow me the creative freedom I wanted nor the technical difficulty. I studied a the Creative Arts(Film & TV production), which was a refreshing change, but like Radiography it soon became repetitive. My fianc√© has her own company and has a suite of socially engaging digital products and it was here, chatting to the developers she used occasionally that I fell in love with coding. I love how technical and ever evolving it is. There is ALWAYS something to learn, and it is unique in that the more you learn and dive into the technically difficult concepts, the more creative it allows you to be. The perfect fit! I've been obsessed with coding since I started learning and love the many challenges that come with it.

### 6. Why have you decided to become a developer?
  * As above, in my previous roles I felt there was a definite ceiling that I had reached in terms of creativity and technical knowhow. Being a developer is an exciting space to work in as there will always be something new to learn or create.

### 7. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
  * I'd like to be leading a team of developers, working accross a range of projects and products. I'd like to be in a position to pass on my knowledge, to teach and nurture developers that are in a similar position as I am now. I'd like to be an active contributer to the development community through online channels, meet-ups and seminars.

### 8. What do you look for when you want to work for a company?
  * I look for a company that is forward thinking in their approach to technology and development. A company that is willing to learn and try a new stack or framework should it seem a good fit. Simply a company that is creative and willing to try new things.
  * I look for a company whos culture is condusive to learning, and who encourage their staff to continue to learn and be active members of the development community.

### 9. What gives you satisfaction in your work? Or what do you think will?
  * I get satisfaction from work when I am out of my comfort zone, when I am challenged and learning new things. I love working with like minded people, who are creative and driven, and supportive of each other.

### 10. Where have you lived, where would you like to live and why?
  * I grew up in Newcastle, Australia and moved to Sydney after University. I've travelled and lived abroad for 4 years, based in the U.K but also lived in parts of South West France. I have lots of friends and family in Newcastle and it is always great to catch up with them all, but in saying that I am happy to work wherever a role will take me. Both Annabelle and I have travelled lots, and don't see moving to somewhere foreign an issue.

### 11. What do you do for fun?
  * We love good food, good wine and good coffee so most of our activities are driven by one of those three ha! In saying that, we have a beautiful 1yr old boy together called Sawyer who is getting more and more cheeky everyday, so spending time together playing with him is just the best!

### 12. What are you passionate about? (generally in life)
  * My gorgeous little family!
  * Good beer, wine & whisky
  * Good food
  * Good coffee
  * Constantly learing and trying new things

### 13. Why are you passionate about tech?
  * As earlier mentioned, it is ever evolving
